Rough Draft,
Create something that inputs text and generates QR code to print labels to stick on books

Work In Progress
This will generate a QR code with the text inputted and automatically make the Windows Pop-Up to show the printer preview
Right now, there is only the QR because I'm unsure how it will fit on the label

1. Best Option - Have a separate field for First & Last name - Also having a sequence number that goes up to 2000 once the QR is generated to see how many are given out and for tracking purposes
    Label can have - Jesse Ashker - #121

2. Bad Option - List text underneath the QR code to match up with the customer who came up to booth
