**Foil Stamping Machine Instructions**

1. Pull Emergency stop to make the machine heat up and spin the wheel
2. Make sure PC is connected to the left side of machine (facing the machine straight on) via VGA cable
3. Once connected, load up the iStamp program on the PC desktop
4. Hit the first row of profiles (two listed, top one is good)
5. Go to File > Open > Marathon Notebook or something similar, forgot the name
6. LINE UP LASER TO EDGE OF COVER, the machine is calibrated to stamp where it is needed to, but for lining up the stamping, I made the laser on the edge of the cover to make it easier to line up

On the show attendees PC, below is the URL to type in First/Last name, and generates a sequential number everytime the Generate QR button is clicked

**Site errors that may popup on Foil text**

There is a 50 character limit on any text that is input in the fields. It has a pop-up stating your text is to long, please revise it. The cover I stamped internally has 45 characters so 50 should be fine as it has 0.5" left available to stamp still.
No label can be generated if first/last name and text is not entered in fields
